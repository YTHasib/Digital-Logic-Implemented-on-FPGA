# Sequential Logic Counters on FPGA (Quartus II)

Design, simulation, and hardware verification of **synchronous sequential logic circuits** implemented on an **Altera DE2-115 FPGA** using **Quartus II**.

This project focuses on converting **formal functional requirements → Boolean logic → hardware-verified circuits**.

## What this demonstrates (recruiter highlights)
- **Sequential logic design** using JK flip-flops
- **State diagrams, excitation tables, and K-map minimization**
- **Hierarchical digital design** in Quartus (symbol creation + reuse)
- **Functional simulation + hardware validation** on FPGA
- **Pin planning & I/O mapping** to LEDs and 7-segment displays

## Implemented designs
- **3-bit synchronous Mod-6 counter**
- **4-bit synchronous BCD counter**
- **Modulo-60 counter** (cascaded Mod-6 + BCD)
- **7-segment display decoders** for each counter

The Mod-60 design cascades two independently verified counters using rollover logic, demonstrating modular design and reuse. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Design methodology
1. Derived **state diagrams** and **excitation tables**
2. Minimized flip-flop input equations using **K-maps**
3. Implemented logic schematics in Quartus (.bdf)
4. Verified behavior with **waveform simulation**
5. Assigned FPGA pins and validated on **DE2-115 hardware**

Simulation waveforms were matched directly against theoretical excitation tables to confirm correctness before hardware testing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Tools & hardware
- **Quartus II (Web Edition)**
- **Altera DE2-115 FPGA board**
- USB-Blaster for programming

## Why this project matters
This repo shows my ability to:
- Translate abstract specifications into real hardware
- Design **clocked digital systems** correctly
- Verify logic at **both simulation and hardware levels**

This is foundational work for CPU design, control units, and FPGA-based systems.
