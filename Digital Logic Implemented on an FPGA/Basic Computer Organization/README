# 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on FPGA

A fully functional **4-bit ALU** implemented on an **Altera DE2-115 FPGA** using **Quartus II**, supporting **16 arithmetic, logic, and shift operations** with real-time status flags.

## What this demonstrates (recruiter highlights)
- **Datapath design** (registers, ALU, control signals)
- **Hierarchical hardware design** (1-bit → 4-bit → system level)
- **Arithmetic + logic circuits** built from basic gates and full adders
- **Status flag generation** (Overflow, Zero, Negative, Carry)
- **Hardware-verified digital systems**

## ALU capabilities
- Operates on two **4-bit operands (A, B)**
- Produces:
  - **4-bit result**
  - Status flags: **V, Z, N, Cy**
- Supports **16 operations**, including:
  - Addition, subtraction (1’s and 2’s complement)
  - Increment, transfer, complement
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - Arithmetic shift left/right

(ALU operation table derived from formal datapath design.) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Architecture
- Input registers for operands A and B
- Separate **Arithmetic Circuit (AC)** and **Logic & Shift Circuit (LSC)**
- Multiplexed result path
- Status logic for flag generation
- Fully synchronous design

Design was implemented hierarchically:
- 1-bit full adder
- 1-bit logic/shift cell
- 4-bit arithmetic and logic blocks
- Top-level ALU integration :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Verification
- Exhaustive **waveform simulation** using Quartus
- Manual operand/control testing via FPGA slide switches
- Output and flags displayed on LEDs

Simulated outputs matched expected micro-operation results with correct clocked timing behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Tools & hardware
- **Quartus II**
- **Altera DE2-115 FPGA**
- USB-Blaster

## Why this project matters
This repo demonstrates:
- How CPUs actually compute at the hardware level
- Solid understanding of **datapath + control separation**
- The ability to build complex logic systems **from first principles**

This is directly applicable to processor design, digital ICs, and FPGA roles.
