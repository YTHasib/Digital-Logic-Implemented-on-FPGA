# Basic Computer Architecture Implementation (FPGA)

Design and implementation of a **basic computer system** on FPGA, closely following classic CPU architecture concepts (control unit + datapath), including **instruction execution, memory access, and machine-code programming**.

## What this demonstrates (recruiter highlights)
- **CPU architecture fundamentals**
- **Control unit design using FSMs**
- **Datapath integration** (registers, ALU, memory, buses)
- **Instruction fetch–decode–execute cycle**
- **Machine-code programming & memory initialization**

## System features
- 8-bit data path
- 256 × 8 memory (program + data)
- Instruction Register, Program Counter, Accumulator, Data Register
- Control Unit implemented with combinational logic + sequencing
- Seven-segment display for memory and output visualization

Architecture closely follows the classical “Basic Computer” model with adaptations for FPGA implementation. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Instruction set
- **Memory-reference instructions** (direct & indirect addressing)
  - AND, ADD, SUB, LDA, STA, BUN, ISZ
- **Register-reference instructions**
  - CLA, CMA, ASL, ASR, INC, HLT

Programs are written directly in **machine code** and loaded using `.mif` memory initialization files. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Verification
- Simulated full instruction execution using waveforms
- Executed real programs on FPGA hardware
- Verified correct results via accumulator and display outputs

Both hardware and software paths were validated through controlled test programs. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Tools & hardware
- **Quartus II**
- **Altera DE2-115 FPGA**
- Memory Initialization Files (.mif)

## Why this project matters
This repo shows I can:
- Design a **complete working CPU**, not just isolated blocks
- Understand instruction formats, control sequencing, and memory
- Debug complex multi-cycle digital systems

This is strong preparation for roles in **computer architecture, FPGA design, and digital systems engineering**.
