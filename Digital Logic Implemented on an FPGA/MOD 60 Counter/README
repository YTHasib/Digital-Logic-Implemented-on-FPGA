# Sequential Counter System on FPGA (Quartus + Altera DE2-115)

## Overview

This project implements a fully functional **Mod-60 counter system** on an Altera DE2-115 FPGA board using synchronous digital design principles.

The system was designed from scratch in Quartus. The logic was derived using excitation tables and Karnaugh map simplifications, verified through simulation, and then deployed to hardware. The final implementation displays real-time counting values on the FPGA’s 7-segment displays.

This project demonstrates:

- Sequential logic design  
- JK flip-flop based state machines  
- Counter cascading (units and tens)  
- Simulation-first verification  
- FPGA pin assignment and hardware debugging

## What I Built

The complete system includes:

- 3-bit synchronous Mod-6 counter  
- 4-bit synchronous BCD counter  
- Cascaded Mod-60 counter (units + tens place)  
- 7-segment display decoding logic  
- Hardware implementation on the Altera DE2-115 board  

The Mod-60 counter increments from **00 → 59** and rolls over correctly. The rollover signal from the BCD counter is used to clock the Mod-6 counter, allowing proper tens-place incrementation.

## Design Approach

Instead of relying on pre-built IP cores, I implemented the counters manually to strengthen my understanding of synchronous digital systems.

The design process involved:

- Creating state diagrams  
- Developing excitation tables  
- Minimizing logic using Karnaugh maps  
- Implementing next-state logic using JK flip-flops  

All logic equations were minimized and implemented structurally in Quartus using schematic capture.

## Simulation & Verification

Before deploying to hardware, the design was validated in simulation:

- Generated waveform simulations in Quartus  
- Applied reset and count control signals  
- Verified correct state transitions  
- Confirmed rollover behavior at 59 → 00  

This step ensured logical correctness before moving to physical implementation.

## Hardware Implementation

After simulation verification:

- Assigned FPGA pins using Quartus Pin Planner  
- Connected outputs to LEDs and 7-segment displays  
- Verified correct timing and counting behavior  
- Debugged incorrect digit mapping issues  

One issue encountered was digit swapping (e.g., 14 displaying as 41). This was traced back to incorrect pin assignments and resolved accordingly.
